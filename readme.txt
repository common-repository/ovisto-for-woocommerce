OVISTO is an exclusive shop-to-shop voucher network to support Aussie retailers and enable them to support each other in generating better leads and higher conversions.
Through the network retailers can offer their exclusive voucher deals to customers of other retailers after the order has been completed.
At the same time OVISTO enables Aussie retailers to reward their customers at the end of the order process by offering them to select an exclusive voucher from another online retailer.
Partners include Tyroola, Costumes.com.au, Wild Earth, Dr Carl, RY.com.au, GoLights, Stuffed With Plush Toys, Mountain Bikes Direct and Discount Party Supplies.
OVISTO has been up and running in Germany since the end of 2014 and it’s very successful as the conversion rates are great and retailers only pay based on performance. It is similar to an affiliate network, it’s just that the publisher is another retailer and the lead quality therefore is significantly higher.
